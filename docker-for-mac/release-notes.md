### New

Docker Desktop is now available for Apple silicon as well as Intel chips. This enables developers with their choice of local development environments, and extends development pipelines for ARM-based applications. For more information, see [Docker Desktop for Apple silicon](apple-silicon.md).

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Docker Desktop now ensures the permissions of `/dev/null` and other devices are correctly set to `0666` (`rw-rw-rw-`) inside `--privileged` containers. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5527](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5527)

### Known issues

**Apple silicon**

- `ping` from inside a container to the Internet does not work as expected. To test the network, we recommend using `curl` or `wget`. See [docker/for-mac#5322](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5322#issuecomment-809392861).
- Users may occasionally experience data drop when a TCP stream is half-closed.

## Docker Desktop 3.3.0
2021-04-08

> [Download](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/stable/amd64/62916/Docker.dmg)

### New

You can now specify when to download and install a Docker Desktop update. When an update becomes available, Docker Desktop displays an icon to indicate the availability of a newer version. You can download the update in the background whenever convenient. When the download is complete, all you need to do is to click Update and restart to install the latest update.

Developers who use Docker Desktop for professional development purposes may at times need to skip a specific update. For this reason, Pro or Team subscription developers can skip notifications for a particular update when a reminder appears.

For developers in IT managed environments, who don’t have administrative access to install updates to Docker Desktop, there is now an option in the Settings menu to opt out of notifications altogether for Docker Desktop updates if your Docker ID is part of a Team subscription.

- Docker Desktop now uses much less CPU when there are lots of file events on the host and when running Kubernetes, see [docker/roadmap#12](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/12).
- Docker Desktop now uses gRPC-FUSE for file sharing by default. This uses much less CPU than osxfs, especially when there are lots of file events on the host. To switch back to `osxfs`, go to **Preferences** > **General** and disable gRPC-FUSE.

### Upgrades

- [Docker 19.03.13](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/tag/v19.03.13)
- [Docker Compose 1.27.4](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.27.4)
- [Go 1.14.7](https://github.com/golang/go/releases/tag/go1.14.7)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Docker Desktop on macOS 10.13 is now deprecated.
- Removed the legacy Kubernetes context `docker-for-desktop`. The context `docker-desktop` should be used instead. Fixes [docker/for-win#5089](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5089) and [docker/for-mac#4089](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5089).
- Adding the application to the dock and clicking on it will launch the container view if Docker is already running.
- Added support for emulating Risc-V via Qemu 4.2.0.
- Removed file descriptor limit (`setrlimit`) of `10240`. We now rely on the kernel to impose limits via `kern.maxfiles` and `kern.maxfilesperproc`.
- Fixed a Mac CPU usage bug by removing the serial console from `hyperkit`, see [docker/roadmap#12]( https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/12#issuecomment-663163280). To open a shell in the VM use either `nc -U ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/debug-shell.sock`.
- Copy container logs without ansi colors to clipboard. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4786](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4786).
- Fixed automatic start on log in. See [docker/for-mac#4877] and [docker/for-mac#4890].
- Fixed bug where the application won't start if the username is too long.
- Fixed a bug where adding directories like `/usr` to the filesharing list prevents Desktop from starting. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4488](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4488)
- Fixed application startup if `hosts` is specified inside the Docker `daemon.json`. See [docker/for-win#6895](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6895#issuecomment-637429117)
- Docker Desktop always flushes filesystem caches synchronously on container start. See [docker/for-mac#4943](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4943).
- Compose-on-Kubernetes is no longer included in the Docker Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the compose-on-kubernetes [release page](https://github.com/docker/compose-on-kubernetes/releases).

### Known issues

-  There is a known issue when using `docker-compose` with named volumes and gRPC FUSE: second and subsequent calls to `docker-compose up` will fail due to the volume path having the prefix `/host_mnt`. To work around this issue, switch back to `osxfs` in Settings. See [docker/for-mac#4859](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4859).
- There is a known issue when enabling Kubernetes where the settings UI fails to update the Kubernetes state. To work around this issue, close and re-open the window.
- There is a rare known issue when switching users where the images view continues to show the repositories of the previous user. To work around this issue, close and re-open the window.

## Docker Desktop Community 2.2.0.5
2020-04-02

> [Download](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/43884/Docker.dmg)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Removed dangling `/usr/local/bin/docker-machine` symlinks which avoids custom installs of  Docker Machine being accidentally deleted in future upgrades. Note that if you have installed Docker Machine manually, then the install might have followed the symlink and installed Docker Machine in `/Applications/Docker.app`. In this case, you must manually reinstall Docker Machine after installing this version of Docker Desktop. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4208](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4208).

- Linux kernel 4.19.76
- [QEMU 4.0.1](https://github.com/docker/binfmt)

### New

- **Docker Desktop Dashboard:** The new Docker Desktop **Dashboard** provides a user-friendly interface which enables you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from the UI. In addition, it allows you to access the logs, view container details, and monitor resource utilization to explore the container behavior.
For detailed information about the new Dashboard UI, see [Docker Desktop Dashboard](../desktop/dashboard.md).

- Introduced a new user interface for the Docker Desktop **Preferences** menu.
- The Restart, Reset, and Uninstall options are now available on the **Troubleshoot** menu.
- Added the ability to start and stop existing Compose-based applications and view combined logs in the Docker Desktop **Dashboard** UI.

- Fixed a bug that did not allow users to copy and paste text in the **Preferences** > **Daemon** window. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3798](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3798).
- Added support for `Expect: 100-continue` headers in the Docker API proxy. Some HTTP clients such as `curl` send this header when the payload is large, for example, when creating containers. Fixes [moby/moby#39693](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/39693).
- Added a loading overlay to the **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** windows to prevent editing conflicts.
- Deactivated the **Reset Kubernetes** button when Kubernetes is not activated.
- Improved the navigation in **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** UI.
- Fixed a bug in the UEFI boot menu that sometimes caused Docker Desktop to hang during restart. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2655](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2655) and [docker/for-mac#3921](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3921).
- Docker Desktop now allows users to access the host’s SSH agent inside containers. Fixes [docker/for-mac#410](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/410)
- Docker Machine is no longer included in the Docker Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the [Docker Machine releases](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases) page.
- Fixed an issue that caused VMs running on older hardware with macOS Catalina to fail on startup with the error `processor does not support desired secondary processor-based controls`.
- Fixed port forwarding when containers are using `overlay` networks.
- Fixed a container start error when a container has more than one port with an arbitrary or not-yet-configured external port number. For example, `docker run -p 80 -p 443 nginx`. Fixes [docker/for-win#4935](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4935) and [docker/compose#6998](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6998).
- Fixed an issue that occurs when sharing overlapping directories.
- Fixed a bug that prevented users from changing the location of the VM disk image.
- Docker Desktop does not inject `inotify` events on directories anymore as these can cause mount points to disappear inside containers. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3976](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3976).
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail on startup when there is an incomplete Kubernetes config file.
- Fixed an issue where attempts to log into Docker through Docker Desktop could sometimes fail with the `Incorrect authentication credentials` error. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4010](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4010).

### Known issues

- When you start a Docker Compose application and then start a Docker App which has the same name as the Compose application, Docker Desktop displays only one application on the Dashboard. However, when you expand the application, containers that belong to both applications are displayed on the Dashboard.

- When you deploy a Docker App with multiple containers on Kubernetes, Docker Desktop displays each Pod as an application on the Dashboard.

* Added `/etc/machine-id` to the virtual machine. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3554](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3554).
* Docker Desktop does not send DNS queries for `docker-desktop.<domain>` every 10s. It now relies on the host’s DNS domain search order rather than trying to replicate it inside the VM.
* Removed the ability to log in using email address as a username as the Docker command line does not support this.
* Docker Desktop now allows running a Docker registry inside a container. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3611](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3611).
* Fixed a stability issue with the DNS resolver.
* Docker Desktop truncates UDP DNS responses which are over 512 bytes in sizes.
* Fixed port 8080 that was used on localhost when starting Kubernetes. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3522](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3522).
* Improved error messaging: Docker Desktop does not prompt users to run diagnostics, or to reset to factory default when it is not appropriate.
* Kubernetes: Docker Desktop now uses the default maximum number of pods for kubelet. [docker/for-mac#3453](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3453).
* Fixed DockerHelper crash. [docker/for-mac#3470](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3470).

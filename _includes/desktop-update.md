Starting with Docker Desktop 3.0.0, updates to Docker Desktop will be available as delta updates from the previous version. When an update is available, Docker Desktop displays an icon to indicate the availability of a newer version. You can choose when to start the download and installation process.

> To encourage developers to stay up to date, Docker Desktop displays a reminder two weeks after an update becomes available. You can dismiss this daily reminder by clicking **Snooze**.

If you have a Pro or a Team subscription, you can skip notifications for a particular update when a reminder appears. Free users will not be required to install any particular update. However, you'll continue to get reminders to update, which you can dismiss.

Click **Download update** When you are ready to download the update. This downloads the update in the background. After downloading the update, click **Update and restart** from the Docker menu. This installs the latest update and restarts Docker Desktop for the changes to take effect.
